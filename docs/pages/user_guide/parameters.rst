List of Parameters
==================

As part of the upgrade from **Incompact3d 2.0** to the now called **Xcompact3d 4.0**, the parameters file was reconfigured to support *NAMELIST I/O*, which produces format-free input for groups of variables. 

For a complete view about how the `.i3d` files are handled, besides to the default value applied to each parameter when not defined by the user, take a look at `parameters.f90 <https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d/blob/master/src/parameters.f90>`_\ .

BasicParam
----------

* ``p_row`` & ``p_col`` define the domain decomposition for (large-scale) parallel computation. Notice that the product of both should be equal to the number of computational cores where Xcompact3d will run, and ``p_row = p_col = 0`` executes the code in auto-tuning mode. More information can be found at `2DECOMP&FFT <http://www.2decomp.org>`_\ ).

* ``nx``, ``ny`` & ``nz`` are the number of mesh points in each direction; Because of the Fast Fourier Transforms, limitations are in place. Basically you need to pick a combination of power of prime numbers. If the boundary conditions are not periodic (``nclXX`` not equal to zero), then you need to add an extra mesh nodes. For instance 1025 (non periodic boundary conditions) instead of 1024 (periodic boundary conditions).

* ``xlx``, ``yly`` & ``zlz`` are the domain size, normalised with the reference length for the simulation (as an example, for a cylinder case, ``xlx=20D`` where ``D`` is the diameter of the cylinder). You can also decide to run simulations with non-normalised quantities, you just need to be consistent! 

* ``itype`` sets the flow configuration, each one is specified in a different ``BC-<flow-configuration>.f90`` file. They are:

    - 0 - User Custom Configuration;
    - 1 - Turbidity Current in Lock-Release;
    - 2 - Taylor-Green Vortices;
    - 3 - Periodic Turbulent Channe`;
    - 4 - Periodic Hill;
    - 5 - Flow over a Cylinder;
    - 6 - Debug Schemes (for developers);
    - 7 - Mixing Layer;
    - 8 - Turbulent Jet (work in progress, currently unsupported);
    - 9 - Turbulent Boundary Layer;
    - 10 - Atmospheric Boundary Layer;
    - 11 - Uniform flow.
You can modify the ``BC-<flow-configuration>.f90`` file to change the inlet and/or initial conditions. Except for the Atmospheric Boundary Layer, quantities are normalised with a reference velocity, a reference length and a constant density, all equal to 1 (as an example, for the cylinder, the reference velocity is the freestream velocity equal to 1,  the diameter equal to 1 and a constant density equal to 1; as a results the Reynolds number is equal to 1/nu).


* ``istret`` controls mesh refinement in y direction only (it is not possible to refine the mesh in more than one direction):

    - 0 - No refinement (default);
    - 1 - Refinement at the center;
    - 2 - Both sides;
    - 3 - Just near the bottom.
    
    More details about the refinement function (which could be changed, but it would have to be represented in the spectral space by few modes only) can be found in *Laizet, S., & Lamballais, E. (2009)*, **High-order compact schemes for incompressible flows: A simple and efficient method with quasi-spectral accuracy**, *Journal of Computational Physics, 228(16), 5989-6015*. The refinement can be control with the parameter ``beta``.

* ``beta`` is the refinement parameter. Large positive ``beta`` will lead to an almost uniform mesh, small positive beta will lead to very stretched mesh. Best option to find a suitable ``beta`` for your simulation is test and trial errrors!

* ``iin`` defines perturbation at the initial condition:

    - 0 - No random noise (default);
    - 1 - Random noise with amplitude of ``init_noise``;
    - 2 - Random noise with fixed seed (important for development and debugging) and amplitude of ``init_noise``.

    .. note::
      The exactly behavior may be different according to each flow configuration. 

* ``inflow_noise`` Random number amplitude at inflow boundary, expressed as a % of the reference velocity (as an example 0.125 correspond to 12.5% of the reference velocity. It is advise to use small values between 0. and 0.1.

* ``re`` Reynolds number, defined using the reference length scale and reference velocity, hence Re=1/nu.

* ``dt`` Time step, to be inputed manually, depending on the mesh resolution, accuracy of the spatial finite-difference schemes and temporal scheme. By experience, the optimal time step can be found by test and trial errors, as opposed to try to compute the CFL number.

* ``ifirst`` First iteration of the simulation. Do not forget to update if you are using a restart/checkpointing file.

* ``ilast`` Last iteration of the simulation.

* ``numscalar`` Number of scalar in the simulation. When using passive scalars, you can have more than one scalar field at the same time (basically you can solver the same transport equations with different initial conditions.

* ``iscalar`` Enables scalar field(s). It is defined to 1 automatically when ``numscalar > 0``.

* ``iibm`` Flag for Immersed Boundary Method:

    - 0 - Off (default);
    - 1 - On with direct forcing method, i.e., it sets velocity to zero inside the solid body.
    - 2 - On with alternating forcing method, i.e, it uses Lagrangian Interpolators to define the velocity inside the body and imposes no-slip condition at the solid/fluid interface, see *Gautier, R., Laizet, S., & Lamballais, E. (2014)*, **A DNS study of jet control with microjets using an immersed boundary method**, *International Journal of Computational Fluid Dynamics, 28(6-10), 393-410* [no longer supported].
    - 3 - On with alternating forcing method, i.e, it uses Cubic Spline Interpolators to define the velocity inside the body and imposes no-slip condition at the solid/fluid interface. Allows for moving objects, see *Giannenas, A. E., & Laizet, S. (2021)*, **A simple and scalable immersed boundary method for high-fidelity simulations of fixed and moving objects on a Cartesian mesh**, *Applied Mathematical Modelling, 99, 606-627*.

* ``ilmn`` Enables Low Mach Number methodology when set to 1, basically solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the low Mach number limit. If you want to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, ``ilmn`` should be equal to 0. See *Bartholomew, P., & Laizet, S. (2019)*, **A new highly scalable, high-order accurate framework for variable-density flows: Application to non-Boussinesq gravity currents**, *Computer Physics Communications, 242, 83-94*.

* ``ilesmod`` Enables Large-Eddy simulations (LES) methodologies:

    - 0 - Off.
    - 1 - Smagorinsky 
    - 2 - WALE **- suitable for wall-bounded flows**
    - 3 - dynamic Smagorinsky **- avoid as the filtering procedure is expensive**
    - 4 - ILES **- prefered options for LES**

Please note that we will eventually remove all explicit LES models from the code as our ILES approach is cheaper with the same quality of results, if not better. 
See *Dairay, T., Lamballais, E., Laizet, S., & Vassilicos, J. C. (2017)*, **Numerical dissipation vs. subgrid-scale modelling for large eddy simulation**, *Journal of Computational Physics, 337, 252-274* and *Mahfoze, O. A., & Laizet, S. (2021)*, **Non-explicit large eddy simulations of turbulent channel flows from Reτ= 180 up to Reτ= 5,200**, *Computers & Fluids, 228, 105019*.

* ``nclx1``, ``nclxn``, ``ncly1``, ``nclyn``, ``nclz1`` & ``nclzn`` define the velocity's boundary condition:

    - 0 - Periodic boundary conditions;
    - 1 - Free-slip boundary conditions, with two options depending on the velocity components: symmetry or anti-symmetry via the parameter ``npaire``. Basically, a free-slip periodic boundary condition in the vertical direction corresponds to u=w=constant (similar to a symmetry boundary condition for which the gradient of u and w in the vertical direction is equal to zero), and to v=0 (similar to an anti-symmetry boundary condition);
    - 2 - Dirichlet boundary conditions.
    
    Note that the fractional step method in the code does not need explicit boundary conditions for the pressure field. 

* ``ivisu`` enables I/O for 3D snapshots if equal to 1 (every ``ioutput`` time step);

* ``ipost`` enables online postprocessing if equal to 1.

* ``gravx``, ``gravy`` & ``gravz`` are the three components of the unitary vector pointing in the gravity's direction, only experimented for gravity currents.

* ``cpg`` is a logical parameter for the momentum source term (Turbulent Channel case only). True / False for an imposed pressure gradient / flow rate.

* ``ifilter`` & ``C_filter`` to filter the solution [set to 0 & 0 except for ABL and wind turbines cases. ``ifilter`` activates the filtering (with different direction combinations given by different values, e.g., 1 is for all directions, 2 for x-z filtering etc) and ``C_filter`` is the filter constant (e.g., C_filter=0 filters at 2Delta, C_filter=0.5 does nothing)

* ``iturbine`` case-specific parameter for the wind farm simulator with 1: Actuator line, 2: actuator disk
